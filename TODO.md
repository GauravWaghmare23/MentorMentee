# TODO: Fix Role-Based Authentication Issues

- [x] Edit app/Login.jsx: Remove incorrect router.push logic and user.role checks from handleLogin. Remove e.preventDefault() as it's not needed in React Native.
- [x] Edit app/Signup.jsx: Remove incorrect router.push logic and user.role checks from handleSignup. Remove e.preventDefault().
- [x] Verify that RedirectAuth.jsx correctly handles redirection based on role.
- [x] Test the authentication flow to ensure roles are set and redirection works.
